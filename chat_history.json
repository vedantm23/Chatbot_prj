Perform 8-12 rounds of 20 seconds high intensity followed by 10 seconds rest.  Total workout time around 4-6 minutes.\n* **Active Recovery:**  Light cardio like walking, swimming, or yoga for 30-45 minutes.  Focus on low impact movement to promote recovery.\n\n**(Day 4: Rest)**\n\n* Complete rest or very light stretching.\n\n**(Day 5: Upper Body Strength (Focus on Arms)**\n\n* **Incline Dumbbell Press:** 3 sets of 8-12 reps.

This is crucial for continuous muscle growth.\n* **Nutrition:**  A balanced diet with sufficient protein is essential for muscle building and fat loss. Aim for a calorie deficit to promote fat burning while still getting enough protein to support muscle growth. Consider lean protein sources, complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats.\n* **Sleep:** Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night for optimal recovery and muscle growth.\n* **Hydration:** Drink plenty of water throughout the day.\n* **Listen to your body:** Rest when you need to and don't push through pain.  Adjust this plan based on your individual needs and progress.\n\nThis plan provides a solid framework. Feel free to adjust exercises based on your equipment and preferences.  Remember consistency and proper form are key to seeing results!  Good luck on your journey!\n"
